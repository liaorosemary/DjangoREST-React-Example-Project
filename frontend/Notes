1. Setup project and app
    A. Basic setup
        npx create-react-app frontend
        npm start

    B. Install bootstrap & reactstrap, and axios
        npm install bootstrap@4.6.0 reactstrap@8.9.0 --legacy-peer-deps

        Include in index.js
            import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

2. Setup axios and connection with API
    A. Install
        npm install axios@0.21.1

    B. Make API location default (allowing for use of relative paths)
        Add to package.json (under "private": true,):
            "proxy": "http://localhost:8000",







Stuff I learned:
- constructor(props), super(props)
    - constructor(props) {}: this is where this.state is assigned, and event handler methods are bound to an instance
        - do NOT call setState() within constructor()
    - super(props): first line that must be written within constructor, otherwise this.props will be undefined in the constructor
        - calls the constructor of the parent class (React.Component)
- this.state
    - do NOT put any parts of props into it
    - used to contain data or info about component (seems like it contains all variables accessible throughout the component --except props, ofc)
- order of methods called when Mounting
    1. constructor()
    2. render()
    3. componentDidMount()
